# CS348 Introduction to AI

This repository contains some of the programming assignments as part of the Northwestern introduction to AI course.

A description of each of the assignments is shown below:

### Lab 0:
* Implement a merge sorting algorithm in Python

### Lab 1:
* Perform Depth first search and Breadth First search on a given matrix map. (Note: I did this using for loops, looking back, I would have used reccursive methods)

### Lab 2:
* Created a program for a greedy hill-climbing search to find minima and solutions to the 10-queens problem

### Lab 3:
* Implemented an A* searching algorithm for a map based on a matrix

### Lab 4:
* Generated a minmax and alpha-beta pruning algorithm to solve a tic-tac-toe board

### Lab 5:
* Create a classic sodoku solver 

### Lab 6:
* Implemented a markov decision process for a moving robot in 2d space

### Lab 7:
* Created a shape detection algorithm for computer vision applications

### Lab 8:
* Line classification with perceptrons
